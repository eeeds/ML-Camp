1. Install BentoML: `pip install bentoml`
2. Try on [train.ipynb](code/train.ipynb)
3. Add `svc.api(input = JSON(), output = JSON(=))` for use the model with curl and rest
4. Call the service with the following command: `bentoml serve service.py:svc`
5. Add `--reload` to reload the service when the code changes
6. Try the following example:
```
{
  "seniority": 3,
  "home": "owner",
  "time": 36,
  "age": 26,
  "marital": "single",
  "records": "no",
  "job": "freelance",
  "expenses": 35,
  "income": 0.0,
  "assets": 60000.0,
  "debt": 3000.0,
  "amount": 800,
  "price": 1000
}
```
7. List of your bento models: `bentoml models list`
8. Get details of your bento model: `bentoml models get credit_risk_model:sqoxub2pw2iygcep`
9. Create your [bentofile.yaml](code/bentofile.yaml)
10. Build your bento (using a bentofile.yaml) with `bentoml build `
11. Results on ![bentoml build](images/bento-model.PNG)
12. Containerize your bento model with `bentoml containerize credit_risk_model:latest`
13. Working with pydantic on `code/service.py`
14. Install pydanctic with `pip install pydantic`
15. Serving with locust, install locust with `pip install locust`
16. Start a local server with `locust -H http://localhost:3000`
where 3000 is the port where the service is running (bentoml).
