## Notes

The concept of ML is depicted with an example of predicting the price of a car. The ML model
learns from data, represented as 
some **features** such as year, mileage, among others, and the **target** variable, in this
case, the car's price.

Then, the model extracts patterns 
from the data and predicts the price of cars that were not considered in the training data. 

In summary, ML is a process of **extracting patterns from data**, which is of two types:

* features (information about the object) and 
* target (correct predictions). 

Therefore, new features are presented to the model, and it makes **predictions** considering learned information.
