## Notes

Add notes from the video (PRs are welcome)

* tensorflow and keras as deep learning libraries
* end-to-end open source machine learning framework
* tensorflow as library for training deep learning models
* keras as high-level abstraction on top of tensorflow
* installing tensorflow
* local vs cloud configuration
* loading and preprocessing images
* keras is part of tensorflow since version 2.0
* working with different image sizes
* processing images using the python pillow library
* encoding images as numpy arrays
* image size (i.e. 150 x 150 pixels) multiplied by number of colors (i.e. RGB) equals shape of array
* numpy array dtype as unsigned int8 (uint8) which includes the range from 0 to 255
