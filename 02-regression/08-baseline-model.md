## Notes

The LR model obtained in the previous section was used with the dataset of car price prediction. For this model, only the numerical variables were considered. 
The training data was pre-processed, replacing the NaN values with 0, in such a way that these values were omitted by the model. Then, the model was trained 
and it allowed to make predictions on new data. Finally, distributions of y target variable and predictions were compared by plotting their histograms. 

The entire code of this project is available in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/chapter-02-car-price/02-carprice.ipynb).
