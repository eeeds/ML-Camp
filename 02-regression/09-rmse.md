## Notes

The RMSE is a measure of the error associated with a model for regression tasks. The video explained the RMSE formula in detail and implemented it in Python. 

The entire code of this project is available in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/chapter-02-car-price/02-carprice.ipynb).
