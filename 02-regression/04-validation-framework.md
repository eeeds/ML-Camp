## Notes

In general, the dataset is split into three parts: training, validation, and test. For each partition, we need to obtain feature matrices (X) and y vectors of targets. First, the size of partitions is calculated, records are shuffled to guarantee that values of the three partitions contain non-sequential records of the dataset, and the partitions are created with the shuffled indices. 

**Pandas attributes and methods:** 

* `df.iloc[]` - returns subsets of records of a dataframe, being selected by numerical indices
* `df.reset_index()` - restate the orginal indices 
* `del df[col]` - eliminates target variable 

**Numpy methods:**

* `np.arange()` - returns an array of numbers 
* `np.random.shuffle()` - returns a shuffled array
* `np.random.seed()` - set a seed
