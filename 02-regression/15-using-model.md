## Notes

After finding the best model and its parameters, it was trained with training and validation partitions and the final evaluation was calculated on the test partition. 
Finally, the final model was used to predict the price of new cars. 

The entire code of this project is available in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/chapter-02-car-price/02-carprice.ipynb).
