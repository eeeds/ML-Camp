## Notes

Categorical variables are typically strings, and pandas identify them as object types. These variables need to be converted to a numerical form because the ML
models can interpret only numerical features. It is possible to incorporate certain categories from a feature, not necessarily all of them. 
This transformation from categorical to numerical variables is known as One-Hot encoding. 

The entire code of this project is available in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/chapter-02-car-price/02-carprice.ipynb).

## Comments

This way of encoding categorical features is called "one-hot encoding".
We'll learn more about it in Session 3.
