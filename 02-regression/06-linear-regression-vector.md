## Notes

The formula of LR can be synthesized with the dot product between features and weights. The feature vector includes the bias term with an x value of one. 
When all the records are included, the LR can be calculated with the dot product between feature matrix and vector of weights, obtaining the y vector of 
predictions. 

The entire code of this project is available in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/chapter-02-car-price/02-carprice.ipynb).
