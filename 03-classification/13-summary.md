## Notes

In this session, we worked on a project to predict churning in customers from a company. We learned the feature importance of numerical and categorical variables, including risk ratio, mutual information, and correlation coefficient. Also, we understood one-hot encoding and implemented logistic regression with Scikit-Learn.
