## Notes
In this chapter we learned this topics:
- We learned how to save the model and load it to re-use it without running the previous code.
- How to deploy the model in a web service.
- How to create a virtual environment.
- How to create a container and run our code in any operating systems.
- How to implement our code in a public web service and aceess it from outside a local computer.

In the next chapter we would learn the algorithms such as Decision trees, Random forests and Gradient boosting as an alternative way of combining decision tress.
