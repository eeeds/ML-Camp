## Notes
As we see how to deploy our apps in AWS Let's find it out how to deploy them in Heroku.
#### Heroku
Here we will learn how to deploy our apps in heroku instead of AWS.
- First of all create your web service with flask. (example file: [churn_prediction.py](https://github.com/amindadgar/customer-churn-app/blob/main/churn_serving.py)
- Then create a file nameed _requirements.txt_ and assing your dependencies there. Example:
 ```
 pickle
 numpy
 flask
 gunicorn
  ```
- Create another file named _Procfile_ and add the app you want to be able to run there. Example:
 ```
web: gunicorn churn_serving:app
  ```
  Note that the churn_serving name in the box above is the name of the main python file we're going to be runned.
 - Create your heroku profile, Go to dashboard and the Deploy tab.
 - Follow the instruction for Deploy using Heroku Git.
 - Great your app is now available from global universe.

I've put my heroku app files in this repository:
